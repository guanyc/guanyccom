## [App Name]
Born to Win - Investment Discipline Assistant (先胜 - 投资纪律助手)

## [Short Description]
Your personal trading journal that helps transform market observations into disciplined actions. Plan your trade, trade your plan.

## [Detailed Description]

### Born to Win is designed to bridge the gap between trading strategy and execution. It helps investors develop and maintain trading discipline through a structured note-taking process that enforces the "Plan your trade, trade your plan" principle.
### It is named after an Chinese verse
"是故胜兵先胜而后求战，败兵先战而后求胜"
which means
"Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist seeks battle only after the victory has been won [i.e., ensured], whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory."
