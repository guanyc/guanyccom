It is named after an Chinese verse
"是故胜兵先胜而后求战，败兵先战而后求胜"
which means
"Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist seeks battle only after the victory has been won [i.e., ensured], whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory."
from [Sūnzǐ: The Art of War 4](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/chin/Suentzyy/Suentzyy04.html)

The notes-taking process is something like below steps:

## note-taking steps

helpful in the process "Plan your trade, trade your plan"(计划你的交易, 交易你的计划)
