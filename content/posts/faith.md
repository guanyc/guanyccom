And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.

31094|As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.|48|6|10

31080|But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,|48|5|22

31064|For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.|48|5|6

31063|For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.|48|5|5

31024|For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.|48|3|26

31023|But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.|48|3|25

31022|Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.|48|3|24

31021|But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.|48|3|23

31020|But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.|48|3|22

31012|That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.|48|3|14

31010|And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.|48|3|12

31009|But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.|48|3|11

31007|So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.|48|3|9

31006|And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.|48|3|8

31005|Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.|48|3|7

31003|He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?|48|3|5

31000|This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?|48|3|2

30997|I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.|48|2|20

30993|Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.|48|2|16

30976|But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.|48|1|23

30065|Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?|47|13|5

30003|Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,|47|10|15

29956|Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.|47|8|7

29901|(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)|47|5|7

29889|We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;|47|4|13

29841|Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.|47|1|24

29763|Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.|51|2|12

29758|Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.|51|2|7

29756|For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.|51|2|5

29745|If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;|51|1|23

29726|Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,|51|1|4

29574|But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.|42|22|32

29408|And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.|42|18|42

29374|I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?|42|18|8

29348|And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.|42|17|19

29335|And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.|42|17|6

29334|And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.|42|17|5

29165|If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?|42|12|28

28971|And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.|42|8|48

28948|And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.|42|8|25

28923|And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.|42|7|50

28882|When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.|42|7|9

28805|And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.|42|5|20

27068|For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.|62|5|4

26975|And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.|59|5|15

26925|For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.|59|2|26

26923|Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.|59|2|24

26921|Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?|59|2|22

26919|But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?|59|2|20

26917|Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.|59|2|18

26916|Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.|59|2|17

26913|What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?|59|2|14

26904|Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?|59|2|5

26900|My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.|59|2|1

26878|But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.|59|1|6

26875|Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.|59|1|3

26783|To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.|44|26|18

26735|And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.|44|24|24

26589|Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.|44|20|21

26430|And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.|44|16|5

26393|And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.|44|15|9

26383|And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.|44|14|27

26378|Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.|44|14|22

26365|The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,|44|14|9

26312|But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.|44|13|8

26273|For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.|44|11|24

26051|And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.|44|6|8

26050|And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.|44|6|7

26048|And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:|44|6|5

25954|And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.|44|3|16

25702|Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.|66|14|12

25682|He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.|66|13|10

25500|I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.|66|2|19

25494|I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.|66|2|13

25456|Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.|60|5|9

25377|Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.|60|1|21

25365|Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.|60|1|9

25363|That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:|60|1|7

25361|Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.|60|1|5

25338|Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.|58|13|7

25304|Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.|58|12|2

25301|And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:|58|11|39

25295|Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,|58|11|33

25293|By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.|58|11|31

25292|By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.|58|11|30

25291|By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.|58|11|29

25290|Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.|58|11|28

25289|By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.|58|11|27

25286|By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;|58|11|24

25285|By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.|58|11|23

25284|By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.|58|11|22

25283|By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.|58|11|21

25282|By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.|58|11|20

25279|By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,|58|11|17

25275|These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.|58|11|13

25273|Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.|58|11|11

25271|By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:|58|11|9

25270|By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.|58|11|8

25269|By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.|58|11|7

25268|But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.|58|11|6

25267|By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.|58|11|5

25266|By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.|58|11|4

25265|Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.|58|11|3

25263|Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.|58|11|1

25261|Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.|58|10|38

25246|Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)|58|10|23

25245|Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.|58|10|22

25146|That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.|58|6|12

25135|Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,|58|6|1

25106|For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.|58|4|2

24779|Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.|40|23|23

24685|Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.|40|21|21

24558|And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.|40|17|20

24518|Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?|40|16|8

24499|Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.|40|15|28

24466|And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?|40|14|31

24246|Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.|40|9|29

24239|But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.|40|9|22

24219|And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.|40|9|2

24209|And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.|40|8|26

24193|When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.|40|8|10

24150|Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?|40|6|30

23982|Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.|54|6|21

23973|Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.|54|6|12

23972|But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.|54|6|11

23971|For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.|54|6|10

23948|Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.|54|5|12

23944|But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.|54|5|8

23932|Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.|54|4|12

23926|If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.|54|4|6

23921|Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;|54|4|1

23917|For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.|54|3|13

23913|Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.|54|3|9

23904|Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.|54|2|15

23896|Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.|54|2|7

23888|Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:|54|1|19

23883|And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.|54|1|14

23874|Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:|54|1|5

23873|Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.|54|1|4

23871|Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.|54|1|2

23858|Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.|46|16|13

23804|And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.|46|15|17

23801|And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.|46|15|14

23747|And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.|46|13|13

23736|And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.|46|13|2

23712|To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;|46|12|9

23468|That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.|46|2|5

23431|But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:|45|16|26

23372|And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.|45|14|23

23371|Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.|45|14|22

23350|Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.|45|14|1

23320|Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;|45|12|6

23317|For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.|45|12|3

23298|Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:|45|11|20

23274|So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.|45|10|17

23265|But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;|45|10|8

23263|But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)|45|10|6

23256|Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;|45|9|32

23254|What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.|45|9|30

23118|By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.|45|5|2

23117|Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:|45|5|1

23111|He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;|45|4|20

23110|And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb:|45|4|19

23107|Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,|45|4|16

23105|For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:|45|4|14

23104|For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.|45|4|13

23103|And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.|45|4|12

23102|And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:|45|4|11

23100|Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.|45|4|9

23096|But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.|45|4|5

23091|Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.|45|3|31

23090|Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.|45|3|30

23088|Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.|45|3|28

23087|Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.|45|3|27

23085|Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;|45|3|25

23082|Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:|45|3|22

23063|For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?|45|3|3

23016|For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.|45|1|17

23011|That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.|45|1|12

23007|First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.|45|1|8

23004|By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:|45|1|5

22964|And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:|50|3|9

22942|Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.|50|2|17

22922|Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;|50|1|27

22920|And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;|50|1|25

22683|Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.|49|6|23

22676|Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.|49|6|16

22608|Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:|49|4|13

22600|One Lord, one faith, one baptism,|49|4|5

22591|That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,|49|3|17

22586|In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.|49|3|12

22560|For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:|49|2|8

22544|Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,|49|1|15

22298|And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.|41|11|22

22276|And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.|41|10|52

22034|And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.|41|5|34

21999|And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?|41|4|40

21901|When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.|41|2|5

7792|And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.|5|32|20

716|But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,|65|1|20

699|Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.|65|1|3

613|And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;|61|1|5

609|Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:|61|1|1

589|That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.|57|1|6

588|Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;|57|1|5

583|All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.|56|3|15

555|That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.|56|2|2

550|This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;|56|1|13

541|To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.|56|1|4

538|Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;|56|1|1

522|I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:|55|4|7

513|And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.|55|3|15

508|But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,|55|3|10

506|Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.|55|3|8

494|Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.|55|2|22

490|Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.|55|2|18

467|Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.|55|1|13

459|When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.|55|1|5

438|And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.|53|3|2

418|Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:|53|1|11

411|So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:|53|1|4

410|We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;|53|1|3

387|But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.|52|5|8

358|Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?|52|3|10

355|Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:|52|3|7

354|But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:|52|3|6

353|For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.|52|3|5

350|And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:|52|3|2

326|For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.|52|1|8

321|Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;|52|1|3

137|Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.|35|2|4
