## Born to Win - Investment Discipline Assistant
is a utility app focused on helping investors develop good investment habits. Through systematic recording and analysis, it helps you establish a personal investment discipline system. This app does not provide any investment advice and serves only as a personal investment management tool.

### [Short Description]
Your personal trading journal that helps transform market observations into disciplined actions. Plan your trade, trade your plan.

### [Detailed Description]

Born to Win is designed to bridge the gap between trading strategy and execution. It helps investors develop and maintain trading discipline through a structured note-taking process that enforces the "Plan your trade, trade your plan" principle. It is named after an Chinese verse
"是故胜兵先胜而后求战，败兵先战而后求胜"
which means
"Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist seeks battle only after the victory has been won [i.e., ensured], whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory."
from [Sūnzǐ: The Art of War 4](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/chin/Suentzyy/Suentzyy04.html)
